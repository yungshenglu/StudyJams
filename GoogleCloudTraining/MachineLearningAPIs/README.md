> Advanced 6 Steps 5 hours 36 Credits

It’s no secret that machine learning is one of the fastest growing fields in tech, and Google Cloud has been instrumental in furthering it’s development. With a host of APIs, Google Cloud has a tool for just about any machine learning job. In this advanced-level quest, you will get hands-on practice with machine learning APIs by taking labs like Detect Labels, Faces, and Landmarks in Images with the Cloud Vision API. Looking for a hands-on challenge lab to demonstrate your skills and validate your knowledge? On completing this quest, enroll in and finish the additional challenge lab at the end of [this quest](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/136) to receive an exclusive Google Cloud digital badge.

## Prerequisites

This Quest requires hands-on experience with Google Cloud’s machine learning services. Make sure that you have at least earned a Badge by completing the hands-on labs in the [Baseline: Data, ML, and AI](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/34) Quest before beginning—the labs in this series assume foundational ML knowledge and will explore advanced features through specific use cases.
