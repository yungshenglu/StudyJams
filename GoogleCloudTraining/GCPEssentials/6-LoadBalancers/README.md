# Set Up Network and HTTP Load Balancers

## GSP007

![](../../../res/img/selfplacedlabs.png)

In this hands-on lab, you'll learn the differences between a network load balancer and a HTTP load balancer, and how to set them up for your applications running on Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

There are several ways you can [load balance in Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/load-balancing-overview#a_closer_look_at_cloud_load_balancers). This lab takes you through the setup of the following load balancers.:

* L3 [Network Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
* L7 [HTTP(s) Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/)

Students are encouranged to type the commands themselves, which helps in learning the core concepts. Many labs include a code block that contains the required commands. You can easily copy and paste the commands from the code block into the appropriate places during the lab.

### What you'll do

* Setup a network load balancer.
* Setup a HTTP(s) load balancer.
* Get hands-on experience learning the differences between network load balancers and HTTP load balancers.

### Prerequisites

* Familiarity with standard Linux text editors such as `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano` is helpful.

## Setup

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access the Google Cloud Platform for the duration of the lab.

### What you need

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
* Time to complete the lab.

> **Note:** If you already have your own personal GCP account or project, do not use it for this lab.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Console

1. Click the `Start Lab` button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left you will see a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.
    ![](../../../res/img/Setup/Setup-1.png)
2. Copy the username, and then click `Open Google Console`. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the **Choose an account** page.
    * **Tip:** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
3. On the **Choose an account** page, click `Use Another Account`.
    ![](../../../res/img/Setup/Setup-2.png)
4. The Sign in page opens. Paste the username that you copied from the Connection Details panel. Then copy and paste the password.
    * **Important:** You must use the credentials from the Connection Details panel. Do not use your Qwiklabs credentials. If you have your own GCP account, do not use it for this lab (avoids incurring charges).
5. Click through the subsequent pages:
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
6. After a few moments, the GCP console opens in this tab.
    * **Note:** You can view the menu with a list of GCP Products and Services by clicking the Navigation menu at the top-left, next to “Google Cloud Platform”.
        ![](../../../res/img/Setup/Setup-3.png)

### Activate Google Cloud Shell

Google Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Google Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your GCP resources.

1. In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the `Open Cloud Shell` button.
    ![](../../../res/img/Setup/Setup-4.png)
2. In the dialog box that opens, click `START CLOUD SHELL`:
    ![](../../../res/img/Setup/Setup-5.png)
    * You can click `START CLOUD SHELL` immediately when the dialog box opens.
3. It takes a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your `PROJECT_ID`. For example:
    ![](../../../res/img/Setup/Setup-6.png)
4. `gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud Platform. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.
    * You can list the active account name with this command:
        ```bash
        $ gcloud auth list
        # Output
        Credentialed accounts:
        - <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)
        # Example output
        Credentialed accounts:
        - google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net
        ```
    * You can list the project ID with this command:
        ```bash
        $ gcloud config list project
        # Output
        [core]
        project = <project_ID>
        # Example output
        [core]
        project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6
        ```
    * Full documentation of `gcloud` is available on [Google Cloud gcloud Overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

## Set the default region and zone for all resources

1. In Cloud Shell, set the default zone:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
    ```
2. Set the default region:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
    ```
    * Learn more about choosing zones and regions here: [Regions & Zones documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones).

> **Note:** When you run gcloud on your own machine, the config settings persist across sessions. In Cloud Shell you need to set this for every new session or reconnection.

## Create multiple web server instances

1. To simulate serving from a cluster of machines, create a simple cluster of Nginx web servers to serve static content using [Instance Templates](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-templates) and [Managed Instance Groups](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/). Instance Templates define the look of every virtual machine in the cluster (disk, CPUs, memory, etc). Managed Instance Groups instantiate a number of virtual machine instances using the Instance Template.
2. To create the Nginx web server clusters, create the following:
   * A startup script to be used by every virtual machine instance to setup Nginx server upon startup
   * An instance template to use the startup script
   * A target pool
   * A managed instance group using the instance template
3. Still in Cloud Shell, create a startup script to be used by every virtual machine instance. This script sets up the Nginx server upon startup:
    ```bash
    $ cat << EOF > startup.sh
    #! /bin/bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y nginx
    service nginx start
    sed -i -- 's/nginx/Google Cloud Platform - '"\$HOSTNAME"'/' /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
    EOF
    ```
4. Create an instance template, which uses the startup script:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute instance-templates create nginx-template \
        --metadata-from-file startup-script=startup.sh
    # Example output
    Created [...].
    NAME           MACHINE_TYPE  PREEMPTIBLE CREATION_TIMESTAMP
    nginx-template n1-standard-1             2015-11-09T08:44:59.007-08:00
    ```
5. Create a target pool. A target pool allows a single access point to all the instances in a group and is necessary for load balancing in the future steps.
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute target-pools create nginx-pool
    # Example output
    Created [...].
    NAME       REGION       SESSION_AFFINITY BACKUP HEALTH_CHECKS
    nginx-pool us-central1
    ```
6. Create a managed instance group using the instance template:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create nginx-group \
        --base-instance-name nginx \
        --size 2 \
        --template nginx-template \
        --target-pool nginx-pool
    # Example output
    Created [...].
    NAME         LOCATION       SCOPE  BASE_INSTANCE_NAME  SIZE  TARGET_SIZE  INSTANCE_TEMPLATE  AUTOSCALED
    nginx-group  us-central1-a  zone   nginx               0     2            nginx-template     no
    ```
    * This creates 2 virtual machine instances with names that are prefixed with `nginx-`. This may take a couple of minutes.
7. List the compute engine instances and you should see all of the instances created:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute instances list
    # Example output
    NAME       ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE  PREEMPTIBLE INTERNAL_IP EXTERNAL_IP    STATUS
    nginx-7wvi us-central1-a n1-standard-1             10.240.X.X  X.X.X.X           RUNNING
    nginx-9mwd us-central1-a n1-standard-1             10.240.X.X  X.X.X.X           RUNNING
    ```
8. Now configure a firewall so that you can connect to the machines on port `80` via the `EXTERNAL_IP` addresses:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute firewall-rules create www-firewall --allow tcp:80
    ```
9. You should be able to connect to each of the instances via their external IP addresses via `http://EXTERNAL_IP/` shown as the result of running the previous command.

## Create a Network Load Balancer

Network load balancing allows you to balance the load of your systems based on incoming IP protocol data, such as address, port, and protocol type. You also get some options that are not available, with HTTP(S) load balancing. For example, you can load balance additional TCP/UDP-based protocols such as SMTP traffic. And if your application is interested in TCP-connection-related characteristics, network load balancing allows your app to inspect the packets, where HTTP(S) load balancing does not.

> **Note:** For more information, see [Setting Up Network Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/).

1. Create an L3 network load balancer targeting your instance group:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules create nginx-lb \
        --region us-central1 \
        --ports=80 \
        --target-pool nginx-pool
    # Example output
    Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...].
    ```
2. List all Google Compute Engine forwarding rules in your project.
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list
    # Example output
    NAME     REGION       IP_ADDRESS     IP_PROTOCOL TARGET
    nginx-lb us-central1 X.X.X.X        TCP         us-central1/targetPools/nginx-pool
    ```
    * You can then visit the load balancer from the browser `http://IP_ADDRESS/` where `IP_ADDRESS` is the address shown as the result of running the previous command.

---
## Create a HTTP(s) Load Balancer

HTTP(S) load balancing provides global load balancing for HTTP(S) requests destined for your instances. You can configure URL rules that route some URLs to one set of instances and route other URLs to other instances. Requests are always routed to the instance group that is closest to the user, provided that group has enough capacity and is appropriate for the request. If the closest group does not have enough capacity, the request is sent to the closest group that does have capacity.

> **Note:** Learn more about the [HTTP(s) Load Balancer in the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/).

1. First, create a [health check](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks). Health checks verify that the instance is responding to HTTP or HTTPS traffic:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute http-health-checks create http-basic-check
    # Example output
    Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...].
    NAME             HOST PORT REQUEST_PATH
    http-basic-check      80   /
    ```
2. Define an HTTP service and map a port name to the relevant port for the instance group. Now the load balancing service can forward traffic to the named port:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed \
        set-named-ports nginx-group \
        --named-ports http:80
    # Example output
    Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...].
    ```
3. Create a [backend service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/backendServices):
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute backend-services create nginx-backend \
        --protocol HTTP --http-health-checks http-basic-check --global
    # Example output
    Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...].
    NAME          BACKENDS PROTOCOL
    nginx-backend          HTTP
    ```
4. Add the instance group into the backend service:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute backend-services add-backend nginx-backend \
        --instance-group nginx-group \
        --instance-group-zone us-central1-a \
        --global
    # Example output
    Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...].
    ```
5. Create a default URL map that directs all incoming requests to all your instances:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute url-maps create web-map \
        --default-service nginx-backend
    # Example output
    Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...].
    NAME    DEFAULT_SERVICE
    Web-map nginx-backend
    ```
    * To direct traffic to different instances based on the URL being requested, see [content-based routing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/content-based-example).
6. Create a target HTTP proxy to route requests to your URL map:
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute target-http-proxies create http-lb-proxy \
        --url-map web-map
    # Example output
    Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...].
    NAME          URL_MAP
    http-lb-proxy web-map
    ```
7. Create a global forwarding rule to handle and route incoming requests. A forwarding rule sends traffic to a specific target HTTP or HTTPS proxy depending on the IP address, IP protocol, and port specified. The global forwarding rule does not support multiple ports.
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules create http-content-rule \
        --global \
        --target-http-proxy http-lb-proxy \
        --ports 80
    # Example output
    Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/...].
    ```
8. After creating the global forwarding rule, it can take several minutes for your configuration to propagate.
    ```bash
    $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list
    # Example output
    NAME                REGION          IP_ADDRESS    IP_PROTOCOL   TARGET
    http-content-rule                   X.X.X.X       TCP           http-lb-proxy
    nginx-lb            us-central1     X.X.X.X       TCP           us-central1/....
    ```
    * Take note of the http-content-rule IP_ADDRESS for the forwarding rule.
9. From the browser, you should be able to connect to `http://IP_ADDRESS/`. It may take three to five minutes. If you do not connect, wait a minute then reload the browser.
