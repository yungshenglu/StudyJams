# Containers in the Cloud

Containers are simple and interoperable, and they enable seamless, fine-grained scaling. Kubernetes is an orchestration layer for containers. Kubernetes Engine is Kubernetes as a service, a scalable managed offering that runs on Google’s infrastructure. You direct the creation of a cluster, and Kubernetes Engine schedules your containers into the cluster and manages them automatically, based on requirements you define. This module explains how Kubernetes Engine works and how it helps deploy applications in containers.

### Key Concepts

* Define the concept of a container and identify uses for containers
* Identify the purpose of and use cases for Google Container Engine and Kubernetes
* Build a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.
